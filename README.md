Hi I'm Will! Thanks for the consideration and I hope you enjoy my code.

To be upfront I am not personally that familiar with React so I initially completed a mostly functional version of the task just using Flask and sqlite3. This was completed well within the time limit. If you run the main.py you can point your browser to the provided address and you should see the page in question. From there you can create a new user by entering all the relevant fields or delete a user by just entering a valid e-mail address. The assumption here was that this was an admin-like function so I did not require the password for delete, although that would be trivial to change. By clicking list users you'll get a list of all the current users with all their information. 

After that I spent about 40 minutes installing a linux distribution and nodejs on my home computer and began work on a version with the react framework as intended.
